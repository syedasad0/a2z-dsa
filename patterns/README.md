# Rules for Printing Any Pattern:

1. **For the outer loop, count the number of rows (lines).**
   
2. **For the inner loop, focus on columns and connect them somehow to the rows (outer loops).**
   
3. **Whatever you are printing, print it inside the inner loop.**
   
4. **Observe if there is any symmetry in the pattern (optional).**
