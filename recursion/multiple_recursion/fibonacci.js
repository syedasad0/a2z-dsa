/*
The "nth Fibonacci number" refers to the number in the Fibonacci sequence that occupies the nth position. In other words, it's the number that appears at index n in the sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are obtained by adding the two previous numbers. So, the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

For example:

The 0th Fibonacci number is 0.
The 1st Fibonacci number is 1.
The 2nd Fibonacci number is 1 (0 + 1 = 1).
The 3rd Fibonacci number is 2 (1 + 1 = 2).
The 4th Fibonacci number is 3 (1 + 2 = 3).
And so on.
So, when someone refers to the "nth Fibonacci number," they mean the number that appears at the nth position in the Fibonacci sequence.
